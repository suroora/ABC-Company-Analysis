### Preprocessing (1 mark)
- Validates schema and data types.
- Replaces the `height` column with random integers between 150 and 180 (inclusive), using a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
- Writes out a cleaned copy: `data/abc_employees_clean.csv`.

### Analysis Tasks
1. **Team distribution + percentage split** (2 marks)  
   - Count of employees by team and share of total.
   - Bar chart with counts and percentage annotations.

2. **Segregate employees by position** (2 marks)  
   - Distribution of employees across positions.
   - Bar chart and Pie Chart

3. **Predominant age group** (2 marks)

   - Total salary by team; total salary by position.
   - Two bar charts.

5. **Correlation between age and salary** (2 marks)  
   - Pearson correlation coefficient.
   - use heat map more finding Correlation 
   - Scatter plot with a simple best-fit line.

### Graphical Representation (10 marks)
Each analysis item above includes a clear plot created with Matplotlib (no seaborn).

### Data Story (3 marks)
A concise narrative at the end of the notebook summarizes key trends, patterns, and correlations observed in your data.
